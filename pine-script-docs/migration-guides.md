[Overview](#overview)
==========

The migration guides catalogue all changes introduced between Pine Script® versions and explain how to rewrite code to convert the indicator successfully. Each guide details sequential changes; for example, the [To Pine Script version 6](/pine-script-docs/migration-guides/to-pine-version-6/) page assumes that the script is already written in Pine v5.

[Pine converter](#pine-converter)
----------

Scripts written in every Pine Script version starting from v3 can be converted to the next version automatically using the converter available in the “Manage Scripts” menu:

A script can be converted only if its code compiles successfully. In rare cases, converting a valid script automatically can result in a script with compilation errors. In that case, resolve the errors using the information in the appropriate article.
