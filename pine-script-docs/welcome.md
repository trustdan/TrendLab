[Welcome to Pine Script® v6](#welcome-to-pine-script-v6)
==========

Pine Script® is [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/)’s programming
language. It allows traders to create their own trading tools and run them on
our servers. We designed Pine Script as a lightweight, yet powerful, language
for developing indicators and strategies that you can then backtest. Most of
TradingView’s built-in indicators are written in Pine Script, and our thriving
community of Pine Script programmers has published more than 150,000 [Community Scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/), half of which are open-source.

==========

It’s our explicit goal to keep Pine Script accessible and easy to understand
for the broadest possible audience. Pine Script is cloud-based and therefore
different from client-side programming languages. While we likely won’t develop
Pine Script into a full-fledged language, we do constantly improve it and are
always happy to consider requests for new features.

Because each script uses computational resources in the cloud, we must impose
limits in order to share these resources fairly among our users. We strive to
set as few limits as possible, but will of course have to implement as many as
needed for the platform to run smoothly. Limitations apply to the amount of data
requested from additional symbols, execution time, memory usage and script size.
