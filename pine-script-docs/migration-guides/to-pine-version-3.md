[To Pine Script® version 3](#to-pine-script-version-3)
==========

This document helps to migrate Pine Script code from `@version=2` to`@version=3`.

[Default behaviour of security function has changed](#default-behaviour-of-security-function-has-changed)
----------

Let’s look at the simple `security` function use case. Add this
indicator on an intraday chart:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

Copied

`// Add this indicator on an intraday (e.g., 30 minutes) chart  
//@version=2  
study("My Script", overlay=true)  
s = security(tickerid, 'D', high, false)  
plot(s)  
`

This indicator is calculated based on historical data and looks somewhat*into the future*. At the first bar of every session an indicator plots
the high price of the entire day. This could be useful in some cases for
analysis, but doesn’t work for backtesting strategies.

We worked on this and made changes in Pine Script version 3. If this
indicator is compiled with `//@version=3` directive, we get a completely
different picture: <img alt="" decoding="async" height="1120" loading="lazy" src="/pine-script-docs/_astro/V3.Dt4jGTcd_256NgY.webp" width="1920">

The old behaviour is still available though. We added a parameter to the`security` function (the fifth one) called `lookahead`.

It can take on the form of two different values:`barmerge.lookahead_off` (and this is the default for Pine Script
version 3) or `barmerge.lookahead_on` (which is the default for Pine
Script version 2).

[Self-referenced variables are removed](#self-referenced-variables-are-removed)
----------

Pine Script version 2 pieces of code, containing a self-referencing
variable:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

Copied

`//@version=2  
//...  
s = nz(s[1]) + close  
`

Compiling this piece of code with Pine Script version 3 will give you
an `Undeclared identifier 's'` error. It should be rewritten as:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

Copied

`//@version=3  
//...  
s = 0.0  
s := nz(s[1]) + close  
`

`s` is now a *mutable variable* that is initialized at line 3. At line 3
the initial value gives the Pine Script compiler the information about
the variable type. It’s a float in this example.

In some cases you may initialize that mutable variable (like `s`) with a`na` value. But in complex cases that won’t work.

[Forward-referenced variables are removed](#forward-referenced-variables-are-removed)
----------

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

Copied

`//@version=2  
//...  
d = nz(f[1])  
e = d + 1  
f = e + close  
`

In this example `f` is a forward-referencing variable, because it’s
referenced at line 3 before it was declared and initialized. In Pine
Script version 3 this will give you an error`Undeclared identifier 'f'`. This example should be rewritten in Pine
Script version 3 as follows:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

Copied

`//@version=3  
//...  
f = 0.0  
d = nz(f[1])  
e = d + 1  
f := e + close  
`

[Resolving a problem with a mutable variable in a security expression](#resolving-a-problem-with-a-mutable-variable-in-a-security-expression)
----------

When you migrate script to version 3 it’s possible that after removing
self-referencing and forward-referencing variables the Pine Script
compiler will give you an error:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

Copied

`//@version=3  
//...  
s = 0.0  
s := nz(s[1]) + close  
t = security(tickerid, period, s)  
`

`Cannot use mutable variable as an argument for security function!`

This limitation exists since mutable variables were introduced in Pine
Script, i.e., in version 2. It can be resolved as before: wrap the code
with a mutable variable in a function:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

Copied

`//@version=3  
//...  
calcS() =>  
s = 0.0  
s := nz(s[1]) + close  
t = security(tickerid, period, calcS())  
`

[Math operations with booleans are forbidden](#math-operations-with-booleans-are-forbidden)
----------

In Pine Script v2 there were rules of implicit conversion of booleans
into numeric types. In v3 this is forbidden. There is a conversion of
numeric types into booleans instead (0 and `na` values are `false`, all
the other numbers are `true`). Example (In v2 this code compiles fine):

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

Copied

`//@version=2  
study("My Script")  
s = close >= open  
s1 = close[1] >= open[1]  
s2 = close[2] >= open[2]  
sum = s + s1 + s2  
col = sum == 1 ? white : sum == 2 ? blue : sum == 3 ? red : na  
bgcolor(col)  
`

Variables `s`, `s1` and `s2` are of *bool* type. But at line 6 we add
three of them and store the result in a variable `sum`. `sum` is a
number, since we cannot add booleans. Booleans were implicitly converted
to numbers (`true` values to `1.0` and `false` to `0.0`) and then they
were added.

This approach leads to unintentional errors in more complicated scripts.
That’s why we no longer allow implicit conversion of booleans to
numbers.

If you try to compile this example as a Pine Script v3 code, you’ll
get an error:`Cannot call `operator +` with arguments (series__bool, series__bool); <...>`It means that you cannot use the addition operator with boolean values.
To make this example work in Pine Script v3 you can do the following:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

Copied

`//@version=3  
study("My Script")  
bton(b) =>  
b ? 1 : 0  
s = close >= open  
s1 = close[1] >= open[1]  
s2 = close[2] >= open[2]  
sum = bton(s) + bton(s1) + bton(s2)  
col = sum == 1 ? white : sum == 2 ? blue : sum == 3 ? red : na  
bgcolor(col)  
`

Function `bton` (abbreviation of boolean-to-number) explicitly converts
any boolean value to a number if you really need this.
