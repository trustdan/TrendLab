[To Pine Script® version 4](#to-pine-script-version-4)
==========

This is a guide to converting Pine Script code from `@version=3` to`@version=4`.

[Converter](#converter)
----------

The Pine Editor can automatically convert v3 indicators and strategies to v4. The Pine converter is described in the [Overview](/pine-script-docs/migration-guides/overview/#pine-converter) page.

Not all scripts can be automatically converted from v3 to v4. If you
want to convert the script manually or if your indicator returns a
compilation error after conversion, consult the guide below for more
information.

[Renaming of built-in constants, variables, and functions](#renaming-of-built-in-constants-variables-and-functions)
----------

In Pine Script v4 the following built-in constants, variables, and
functions were renamed:

* Color constants (e.g `red`) are moved to the `color.*` namespace
  (e.g. `color.red`).
* The `color` function has been renamed to `color.new`.
* Constants for `input()` types (e.g. `integer`) are moved to the`input.*` namespace (e.g. `input.integer`).
* The plot style constants (e.g. `histogram` style) are moved to the`plot.style_*` namespace (e.g. `plot.style_histogram`).
* Style constants for the `hline` function (e.g. the `dotted` style)
  are moved to the `hline.style_*` namespace (e.g.`hline.style_dotted`).
* Constants of days of the week (e.g. `sunday`) are moved to the`dayofweek.*` namespace (e.g. `dayofweek.sunday`).
* The variables of the current chart timeframe (e.g. `period`,`isintraday`) are moved to the `timeframe.*` namespace (e.g.`timeframe.period`, `timeframe.isintraday`).
* The `interval` variable was renamed to `timeframe.multiplier`.
* The `ticker` and `tickerid` variables are renamed to`syminfo.ticker` and `syminfo.tickerid` respectively.
* The `n` variable that contains the bar index value has been renamed
  to `bar_index`.

The reason behind renaming all of the above was to structure the
standard language tools and make working with code easier. New names are
grouped according to assignments under common prefixes. For example, you
will see a list with all available color constants if you type ‘color’
in the editor and press Ctrl + Space.

[Explicit variable type declaration](#explicit-variable-type-declaration)
----------

In Pine Script v4 it’s no longer possible to create variables with an
unknown data type at the time of their declaration. This was done to
avoid a number of issues that arise when the variable type changes after
its initialization with the na value. From now on, you need to
explicitly specify their type using keywords or type functions (for
example, `float`) when declaring variables with the na value:

Copied

`//@version=4  
study("Green Candle Close")  
// We expect `src` to hold float values, so we declare in with the `float` keyword  
float src = na  
if close > open  
src := close  
plot(src)  
`
