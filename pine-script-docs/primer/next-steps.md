[Next steps](#next-steps)
==========

After your [first steps](/pine-script-docs/primer/first-steps/)and your [first indicator](/pine-script-docs/primer/first-indicator/), let us explore a bit more of the Pine Script® landscape by
sharing some pointers to guide you in your journey to learn Pine
Script.

[”indicators” vs “strategies”](#indicators-vs-strategies)
----------

Pine Script [strategies](/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/)are used to backtest on historical data and forward test on open
markets. In addition to indicator calculations, they contain`strategy.*()` calls to send trade orders to Pine Script’s broker
emulator, which can then simulate their execution. Strategies display
backtest results in the “Strategy Tester” tab at the bottom of the
chart, next to the “Pine Editor” tab.

Pine Script indicators also contain calculations, but cannot be used in
backtesting. Because they do not require the broker emulator, they use
less resources and will run faster. It is thus advantageous to use
indicators whenever you can.

Both indicators and strategies can run in either overlay mode (over the
chart’s bars) or pane mode (in a separate section below or above the
chart). Both can also plot information in their respective space, and
both can generate [alert events](/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/).

[How scripts are executed](#how-scripts-are-executed)
----------

A Pine script is **not** like programs in many programming languages
that execute once and then stop. In the Pine Script *runtime*environment, a script runs in the equivalent of an invisible loop where
it is executed once on each bar of whatever chart you are on, from left
to right. Chart bars that have already closed when the script executes
on them are called *historical bars*. When execution reaches the
chart’s last bar and the market is open, it is on the *realtime bar*.
The script then executes once every time a price or volume change is
detected, and one last time for that realtime bar when it closes. That
realtime bar then becomes an *elapsed realtime bar*. Note that when the
script executes in realtime, it does not recalculate on all the chart’s
historical bars on every price/volume update. It has already calculated
once on those bars, so it does not need to recalculate them on every
chart tick. See the[Execution model](/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/)page for more information.

When a script executes on a historical bar, the[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)built-in variable holds the value of that bar’s close. When a script
executes on the realtime bar,[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)returns the **current** price of the symbol until the bar closes.

Contrary to indicators, strategies normally execute only once on
realtime bars, when they close. They can also be configured to execute
on each price/volume update if that is what you need. See the page on[Strategies](/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/) for more
information, and to understand how strategies calculate differently than
indicators.

[Time series](#time-series)
----------

The main data structure used in Pine Script is called a[time series](/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/#time-series). Time
series contain one value for each bar the script executes on, so they
continuously expand as the script executes on more bars. Past values of
the time series can be referenced using the history-referencing
operator:[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D).`close[1]`, for example, refers to the value of[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)on the bar preceding the one where the script is executing.

While this indexing mechanism may remind many programmers of arrays, a
time series is different and thinking in terms of arrays will be
detrimental to understanding this key Pine Script concept. A good
comprehension of both the[execution model](/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/) and[time series](/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/#time-series) is
essential in understanding how Pine scripts work. If you have never
worked with data organized in time series before, you will need practice
to put them to work for you. Once you familiarize yourself with these
key concepts, you will discover that by combining the use of time series
with our built-in functions specifically designed to handle them
efficiently, much can be accomplished in very few lines of code.

[Publishing scripts](#publishing-scripts)
----------

TradingView is home to a large community of Pine Script programmers and
millions of traders from all around the world. Once you become
proficient enough in Pine Script, you can choose to share your scripts
with other traders. Before doing so, please take the time to learn Pine
Script well-enough to supply traders with an original and reliable
tool. All publicly published scripts are analyzed by our team of
moderators and must comply with our [Script Publishing
Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599), which
require them to be original and well-documented.

If you want to use Pine scripts for your own use, simply write them in the
Pine Editor and add them to your chart from there; you don’t have to
publish them to use them. If you want to share your scripts with just a
few friends, you can publish them privately and send your friends the
browser’s link to your private publication. See the page on[Publishing](/pine-script-docs/writing/publishing/) for more
information.

[Getting around the Pine Script documentation](#getting-around-the-pine-script-documentation)
----------

While reading code from published scripts is no doubt useful, spending
time in our documentation will be necessary to attain any degree of
proficiency in Pine Script. Our two main sources of documentation on
Pine Script are:

* This Pine Script [v6 User
  Manual](/pine-script-docs/welcome/)
* Our Pine Script [v6 Reference
  Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/)

The Pine Script [v6 User Manual](/pine-script-docs/welcome/), which is located on its separate page and in English only.

The Pine Script [v6 Reference Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/) documents what each language construct does. It is an essential tool for all Pine Script programmers; your life will be miserable if you try to write scripts of any reasonable complexity without consulting it. It exists in two formats: a separate page linked above, and the popup
version. Access the popup version from the Pine Editor by either selecting `Ctrl` or `Cmd` and selecting a keyword, or by using the Editor’s “More/Reference Manual…” menu. The Reference Manual is translated into multiple languages.

There are six different versions of Pine Script released. Ensure the
documentation you use corresponds to the Pine Script version you are
coding with.

[Where to go from here?](#where-to-go-from-here)
----------

This Pine Script [v6 User Manual](/pine-script-docs/welcome/) contains numerous examples of code used to illustrate the concepts we discuss. By going through it, you will be able to both learn the
foundations of Pine Script and study the example scripts. Reading about
key concepts and trying them out right away with real code is a
productive way to learn any programming language. As you hopefully have
already done in the[First indicator](/pine-script-docs/primer/first-indicator/)page, copy this documentation’s examples in the Editor and play with
them. Explore! You won’t break anything.

This is how the Pine Script [v6 User Manual](/pine-script-docs/welcome/) you are reading is organized:

* The [Language](/pine-script-docs/language/) section
  explains the main components of the Pine Script language and how
  scripts execute.
* The [Concepts](/pine-script-docs/concepts/) section
  is more task-oriented. It explains how to do things in Pine Script.
* The [Writing](/pine-script-docs/writing/) section
  explores tools and tricks that will help you write and publish
  scripts.
* The [FAQ](/pine-script-docs/faq/) section answers
  common questions from Pine Script programmers.
* The [Error messages](/pine-script-docs/error-messages/) page documents causes and fixes for the most common
  runtime and compiler errors.
* The [Release Notes](/pine-script-docs/release-notes/)page is where you can follow the frequent updates to Pine Script.
* The [Migration guides](/pine-script-docs/migration-guides/) section explains how to port between different versions
  of Pine Script.
* The[Where can I get more information](/pine-script-docs/where-can-i-get-more-information/) page lists other useful Pine Script-related content,
  including where to ask questions when you are stuck on code.

We wish you a successful journey with Pine Script… and trading!
