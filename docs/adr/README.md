# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for TrendLab.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences. They help us:
- Remember why decisions were made
- Onboard new contributors quickly
- Revisit decisions when context changes
