## Strategy Logic

### Indicator
Tracks the highest high over the lookback period:
- **Period High**: ta.highest(high, 115)

### Entry Rule
Enter long when close >= 70% of the 115-day period high.

This means: enter when price is within 30% of its recent high (showing strength).

### Exit Rule
Exit long when close < 52% of the 115-day period high.

This means: exit when price has dropped more than 48% from its recent high (showing significant weakness).

Generate a Pine Script v6 strategy that replicates the following:

**Strategy**: 52-Week High Breakout
**Parameters**:
- Lookback Period: 115 bars
- Entry Threshold: 70% of period high
- Exit Threshold: 52% of period high

**Entry Rule**: Enter long when close >= period_high * 0.70
Where period_high = ta.highest(high, 115)

**Exit Rule**: Exit long when close < period_high * 0.52

**Fill Model**: Execute trades on the next bar's open after signal

**Important**:
1. Use ta.highest(high, 115) for the period high calculation
2. Entry triggers when price is within 30% of its 115-day high
3. Exit triggers when price drops below 52% of its 115-day high
4. Use strategy.entry() and strategy.close() for position management
5. Set default_qty_type to strategy.percent_of_equity with 100% allocation
6. Note: This uses the HIGH of the lookback period, not the close
